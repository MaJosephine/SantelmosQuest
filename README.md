# SantelmosQuest
Santelmo, a lost mythical creature, is trying to find his way back home to the town of Liwanag. However, he's stranded on an island with a treacherous river separating him from his destination. To cross the river, Santelmo must leap from log to log—but the challenge doesn’t end there!

To help Santelmo, players must solve traditional Philippine riddles. Each correct answer makes a log appear, allowing him to progress safely. But be careful: if you answer incorrectly, Santelmo will lose a life, risking a fall into the dangerous waters. Can you guide Santelmo home? Good luck!
